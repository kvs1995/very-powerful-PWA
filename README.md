# Totally Awesome Text Editor [![MIT License](<https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg>)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  In this application, we have created a very basic downloadable text editor, similar to Atom or Brackets. This can come in handy just for psuedocode or if you have random notes to jot down. The applcation utilizes PWA criteria so that the application runs in your browser, even if you are offline.

  ## Installations
  This app is deployed to heroku so technically, there are no installations needed. If the user would like to take a look at the code and application via the terminal. Following the node module installs and build, the user can run `npm run start`. 

  ## Usage
  This can be used as a very basic text editor that can be utilized across both online and offline platforms, if the offline version is installed. The indexDB will log all edits made. 
  
  Take a look at this short video for a walkthrough on how to use the application:
